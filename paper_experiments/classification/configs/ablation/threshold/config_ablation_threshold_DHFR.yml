# input_features: determine how the input features should be transformed, the following options show some examples
#  - {name: constant, value: 1.0}, use a constant value as input feature
#  - {name: node_labels, transformation: normalize}, use node labels and normalize them between -1 and 1
#  - {name: node_labels, transformation: normalize_positive}, use node labels and normalize them between 0 and 1
#  - {name: node_labels, transformation: unit_circle, features_as_channels: True}, use node labels mapped to the 2D unit circle, use features as channels
#  - {name: node_labels, transformation: one_hot, features_as_channels: True}, use node labels and transform them to one-hot encoding
#  - {name: node_features, features_as_channels: True}, use node features as input, use features as channels
#  - {name: all, features_as_channels: True}, use node labels and node features as input, use features as channels
